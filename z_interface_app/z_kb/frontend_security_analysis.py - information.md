### 3.3 Data Flow Sequences
Operation: Run Security Analysis
1. `FrontendSecurityAnalyzer` receives model/app identifiers and options
2. `_find_application_path` locates the frontend application directory
3. `_check_source_files` verifies relevant files exist for analysis
4. Tool runners are dispatched concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor
5. Each tool runner:
   a. Sets up necessary configuration (temp files if needed)
   b. Executes the tool via `_run_frontend_tool`
   c. Parses tool output into SecurityIssue objects
   d. Returns issues, status, and raw output
6. Issues from all tools are aggregated and sorted by severity
7. Analysis summary is generated via `get_analysis_summary`
8. Sorted issues, tool statuses, and raw outputs are returned

## 4. Core Data Structures
DATA STRUCTURE: SecurityIssue

EXAMPLES:
```python
# Valid instance example:
{
  "filename": "src/components/Login.jsx",
  "line_number": 42,
  "issue_text": "[no-eval] eval can be harmful",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "issue_type": "eslint_no-eval",
  "line_range": [42],
  "code": "eval(userInput);",
  "tool": "eslint",
  "fix_suggestion": "Use safer alternatives like Function constructor"
}
```

### 7.3 Environment Requirements
- Runtime dependencies:

  - npm for npm-audit
  - npx for ESLint and JSHint
  - Snyk for vulnerability scanning
  
- Configuration requirements:
  - Properly structured project directory
  - Sufficient permissions to run external tools
  - package.json for npm-audit and Snyk
  
- Resource needs:
  - Memory: Moderate, depends on codebase size
  - CPU: Multiple cores for concurrent execution
  - Disk: Space for temporary config files
  - Network: Required for Snyk analysis

## 8. Reasoning Patterns
### 8.1 Key Algorithms
ALGORITHM: Concurrent Tool Execution

PURPOSE: Execute multiple security tools in parallel for better performance

INPUT: 
- List of tools to run
- Application path

OUTPUT: 
- Combined results from all tools

STEPS:
1. Determine available and selected tools
2. Create ThreadPoolExecutor with limited workers
3. Submit each tool's runner function to the executor
4. Collect results as tools complete using as_completed
5. Handle exceptions for each tool independently
6. Combine results from all tools
7. Sort issues by severity and other criteria

COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(n) where n is number of files (limited by slowest tool)
- Space: O(m) where m is number of issues found

CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum concurrent tasks limited by ThreadPoolExecutor
- Timeout for each tool to prevent hanging
- Depends on external tools being installed

ALGORITHM: Application Path Detection

PURPOSE: Locate the frontend application directory using heuristics

INPUT:
- Model name
- Application number
- Base path

OUTPUT:
- Path to the frontend application directory

STEPS:
1. Construct base application directory from model/app info
2. Check if base directory exists
3. Check prioritized list of potential frontend directories:
   - "frontend"
   - "client"
   - "web"
   - Base directory itself
4. For each candidate, check for frontend indicators:
   - package.json
   - Common framework config files
5. Return first directory that matches criteria
6. Fall back to base directory if no match

COMPLEXITY:
- Time: O(d) where d is number of directories checked
- Space: O(1)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Assumes conventional project structure
- Requires filesystem read access

### 8.2 Design Decisions
DECISION: Concurrent Tool Execution

CONTEXT: Running security tools sequentially is slow for large codebases.

OPTIONS CONSIDERED:
1. Sequential execution - Simple but slower
2. ThreadPoolExecutor - Faster with manageable complexity
3. Multiprocessing - Maximum parallelism but higher overhead

DECISION OUTCOME: ThreadPoolExecutor approach
- Provides significant performance improvement
- Allows independent tool execution
- Handles tool failures gracefully

CONSEQUENCES:
- More complex error handling
- Need to ensure thread safety
- Potential resource contention

DECISION: Custom Tool Output Parsers

CONTEXT: Different security tools output results in various formats.

OPTIONS CONSIDERED:
1. Standardized output format requirement - Simpler but restrictive
2. Custom parsers for each tool - More complex but flexible
3. Third-party parsers - Additional dependencies

DECISION OUTCOME: Custom parsers for each tool
- Maximum flexibility for tool-specific formats
- Consistent normalized output
- Better error handling control

CONSEQUENCES:
- Need to maintain parser logic for each tool
- Additional code complexity
- More robust to tool output variations

### 10.3 Common Issues
ISSUE: Tools not found in PATH

SYMPTOMS:
- Tool status reported as "❌ Not available"
- Logs show "Executable not found in PATH"

CAUSES:
- Required tools not installed
- PATH environment variable not configured
- Platform-specific executable differences

RESOLUTION:
1. Install missing tools
2. Add tool locations to PATH
3. Verify with command line that tools are available

PREVENTION:
- Pre-check environment before running analysis
- Document tool requirements

ISSUE: Authentication required for Snyk

SYMPTOMS:
- Snyk status: "❌ Authentication required"
- Authentication errors in output

CAUSES:
- No valid Snyk token
- Token expired

RESOLUTION:
1. Run `snyk auth` to authenticate
2. Set up CI environment with Snyk token

PREVENTION:
- Document authentication requirements
- Include auth check in setup

ISSUE: ESLint plugin/config errors

SYMPTOMS:
- ESLint status: "❌ Plugin/Config Issue"
- Plugin-related errors in output

CAUSES:
- Missing ESLint plugins
- Incompatible ESLint configuration
- ESLint version conflicts

RESOLUTION:
1. Install required plugins
2. Use temporary basic config (implemented in code)
3. Check for ESLint version compatibility

PREVENTION:
- Provide fallback configuration (already implemented)
- Document ESLint requirements

## 11. Task-Oriented Guides
### 11.1 Common Development Tasks
TASK: Run the analyzer on a project

PREREQUISITES:
- Python 3.6+ environment
- Required tools installed (npm, npx, snyk as needed)
- Project with expected directory structure

STEPS:
1. Import the module:
   ```python
   from frontend_security_analysis import FrontendSecurityAnalyzer
   ```
2. Create analyzer instance:
   ```python
   analyzer = FrontendSecurityAnalyzer(base_path="path/to/projects")
   ```
3. Run analysis:
   ```python
   issues, statuses, outputs = analyzer.run_security_analysis(
       model="Llama", 
       app_num=2, 
       use_all_tools=True
   )
   ```
4. Process results:
   ```python
   summary = analyzer.get_analysis_summary(issues)
   print(f"Found {summary['total_issues']} issues:")
   for issue in issues[:10]:  # Show top 10 issues
       print(f"- [{issue.severity}] {issue.filename}:{issue.line_number} - {issue.issue_text}")
   ```

VERIFICATION:
- Check returned issues list
- Verify tool statuses for execution success
- Review summary statistics

TASK: Add a new security tool

PREREQUISITES:
- Understanding of tool's CLI interface
- Knowledge of tool's output format
- Python development environment

STEPS:
1. Add tool to available tools list in `__init__`:
   ```python
   self.all_tools = ["npm-audit", "eslint", "jshint", "snyk", "new-tool"]
   self.available_tools["new-tool"] = bool(get_executable_path("new-tool"))
   ```
2. Create parser method:
   ```python
   def _parse_new_tool(self, stdout: str) -> List[SecurityIssue]:
       # Parse tool output into SecurityIssue objects
       issues = []
       # Parsing logic...
       return issues
   ```
3. Create runner method:
   ```python
   def _run_new_tool(self, app_path: Path) -> Tuple[List[SecurityIssue], Dict[str, str], str]:
       tool_name = "new-tool"
       status = {tool_name: "⚠️ Not run"}
       # Tool execution logic...
       return issues, status, raw_output
   ```
4. Add to tool map in run_security_analysis:
   ```python
   tool_map = {
       # Existing tools...
       "new-tool": self._run_new_tool
   }
   ```

VERIFICATION:
1. Run analyzer with new tool enabled
2. Check for correct execution and output
3. Verify issues are properly detected

### 11.2 Debugging Approaches
SCENARIO: Application path not found

DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:
1. Check logs for "Application directory not found" messages
2. Verify base path is correct and absolute
3. Check directory structure matches expectations
4. Add debug logging to _find_application_path

COMMON CAUSES:
- Incorrect base_path parameter
- Non-standard directory structure
- Missing directories or permissions issues

SCENARIO: Tool execution times out

DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:
1. Check project size (number of files)
2. Look for specific problematic files
3. Try running the tool manually to confirm
4. Increase timeout parameter

COMMON CAUSES:
- Very large codebase
- Complex or problematic files
- Resource constraints
- Tool configuration issues
